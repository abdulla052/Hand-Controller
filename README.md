# Hand-Controller
Welcome to the Hand-Controller repository! This is a computer vision project written in Python that allows youto control games using hand gestures without the need for any additional equipment.

## Description
The Hand-Controller project utilizes computer vision techniques to track and interpret hand movements, enabling you to interact with games and applications. By using your hands as input, you can control various aspects of the game or application without the need for a traditional controller or keyboard.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Hand-Controller project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or later)  
- OpenCV library  
- Numpy library
